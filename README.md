# CMD
A Terminal emulator created using JFrames

ApplicationMain -> Starting point

A <u>Screen</u> contains multiples of <u>Entry(s)</u>, each <u>Entry</u> can point to another <u>Screen</u>, allowing a user to navigate the program.

All possible <u>Screen(s)</u> are stored in the <u>ScreensDatabase</u> for the time being.

Settings are currently stored in the <u>setting.txt</u> file; which is specifically formatted, but allows some minor modifications, in the future the <u>ScreensDatabase</u> will also need to be stored in an editable file. (To allow easy modifications)

The <u>Entity</u> exists to add some gameplay mechanics- and is mostly a placeholder at this time.
